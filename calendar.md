# Course Calendar for Fall 2019 - PQHS 431

All classes take place in room E321-323 of the Wood Building at the School of Medicine, from 1:00 to 2:15 PM.

- Click on the README link for slides and more information about the associated class session.
- TA office hours are posted [at the bottom of the calendar](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/calendar.md#ta-office-hours). 
- Books we are reading include:
  - **Silver** *The Signal and the Noise*. Some chapters will seem more relevant to you than others, and feel free to skim those in an initial reading. The most important chapters are the Introduction, Chapters 1-3, 6-8 and 12, according to past students in the course.
  - **Leek** *The Elements of Data Analytic Style*. The book is short, and I encourage you to just read it as soon as possible (it won't take more than a couple of hours), then refer to it later in the term as specific issues arise.
  - **R4DS** [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. This semester, we'll focus more on the Explore (Section I) and Communicate (Section V) materials than we will in 432. I encourage you to read these sections at your own pace through the term.

## Final Projects - Your Presentation

Everyone in the class will complete a [final project](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/tree/master/PROJECT), and present it to Dr. Love, either on 2019-12-09, 2019-12-10 or 2019-12-12. [There is a form to describe your preferences for scheduling](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/tree/master/PROJECT/SCHEDULE), which is due at 9 AM on 2019-09-30. Dr. Love will finalize the schedule in early October. For planning purposes, you will not be attending any project presentations other than your own, and your presentation will take between 20 and 30 minutes.
