Everyone in the class will complete a [final project](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/tree/master/PROJECT), and present it to Dr. Love, either on 2019-12-09, 2019-12-10 or 2019-12-12. [There is a form to describe your preferences for scheduling](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/tree/master/PROJECT/SCHEDULE), which is due at 9 AM on 2019-09-30. Dr. Love will finalize the schedule in early October. For planning purposes, you will not be attending any project presentations other than your own, and your presentation will take between 20 and 30 minutes.
