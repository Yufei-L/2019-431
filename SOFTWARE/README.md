# Software for 431 in Fall 2019

## Installation

- Visit [the Install R page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/SOFTWARE/installR.md) for complete information on installing R and R Studio as well as obtaining the data and code you'll need in 431, on either a PC or a Macintosh computer.
- Visit [the R Packages page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/SOFTWARE/PACKAGES.md) for details on the R packages we're using in 431.
- Download the data and code (functions) we've developed for the course from our [Data page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431-data).

If you need more help, you might look at [this terrific resource for Installing R and R Studio](http://stat545.com/block000_r-rstudio-install.html) from Jenny Bryan and the STAT 545 project. These are the people responsible for the great [Happy Git with R](http://happygitwithr.com/) project, which is worth your time, too, if you intend to use Git and GitHub.

## Getting Started with R, RStudio and R Markdown

1. Professor Love will demonstrate the use of R, RStudio and R Markdown in class, beginning with Class 2.
2. Professor Love's document entitled **Getting Started with R** is a good first step. It demonstrates some of the details on how to use these tools to actually analyze data. 
    - [Here is the R Markdown code](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/SOFTWARE/431-getting-started-with-R.Rmd).
    - [Here is the downloadable PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/SOFTWARE/431-getting-started-with-R.pdf).
    - [Here is an HTML file](http://rpubs.com/TELOVE/getting-started-2019) that the R Markdown code produces, if you'd like to see it.
    - Here is the [431-r-template.Rmd](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/SOFTWARE/431-r-template.Rmd) file that Dr. Love refers to in the Getting Started with R materials. 
        - This template, along with templates for some of the course Deliverables, is available on our [Data (and code) page](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431-data).
3. We can also recommend Chester Ismay and Patrick Kennedy's [Getting Used to R, RStudio and R Markdown](https://rbasics.netlify.com/) as an introduction to the basics.
4. The [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-431-book/), of course, are a source of many useful examples in how to use R.

## Advice on Technology / System Requirements

You will need a laptop computer in this class, not just an iPad or other tablet, but an actual computer. All of the software we will use in this class is either free and open source, or available to you for free through your affiliation with CWRU, so there is nothing to buy if you have a laptop.

- We've made some effort in terms of course requirements to set the bar low. You do not need a state of the art machine, nor should you need any special hardware to run things for this course.
    - You will need a laptop, either PC or Mac, but the style should be determined by your personal preferences and how you believe you will use the machine in your research life. Dr. Love uses a fairly old MacBook Air in class, and a series of desktop PCs at offices around Cleveland.
    - In this class, you'll be using R Studio and R, which look and work the same on either a PC or a Mac. 
    - Any reasonably recent PC or Macintosh machine will work well. 
    - I **do not** recommend the use of a Chrome device for this class.
    - If you have a Linux system, you can certainly run R and R Studio well, and you definitely know better than I do how to accomplish that.
