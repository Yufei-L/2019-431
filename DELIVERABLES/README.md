# Fall 2019 Deliverables for 431: Professor Love

## Some General Advice

All deadlines are listed on the [Course Calendar](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/calendar.md), which will be the final word, if there is some discrepancy.

1. Almost every Deliverable will require you to analyze some data, and prepare a report using R Markdown. You will submit both your Markdown file, and an HTML document built using R Studio from that Markdown file. 
2. Several Deliverables will require you to write an essay. After Deliverable A, essays must be composed as part of your Markdown file, and thus included in your HTML document. Do not edit the result of your R Markdown conversion into Word.
3. When writing in English, use complete sentences, rather than bullet points.
4. Clearly mark each Question in each Deliverable. There is no need to repeat the question before answering it, although you are welcome to do so.
5. Read and heed the advice of Jeff Leek in *The Elements of Data Analytic Style*. Chapters 5, 9, 10 and 13 of that book are especially relevant to our early assignments.
6. You are welcome to discuss each Deliverable with anyone, including Professor Love, the teaching assistants, or your colleagues, but your answer must be prepared by you alone. We especially encourage you to take advantage of TA office hours and email **431-help at case dot edu**.
7. In general, we do not guarantee to provide answers to questions that we receive in the last 18 hours before a Deliverable is due, especially once we've gotten into mid-September. So don't leave anything until the last day. Allow time for computer problems.
8. Late work is inappropriate for graduate school. Failure to turn in a Deliverable within one hour of the deadline will result in a very poor grade on the Deliverable if it is (eventually) turned in, and a zero (from which it is difficult to recover) if it is not turned in. **Submission of timely, but partial work is far better than no submission at all.**
9. If a Deliverable is scheduled so that you will not be able to complete it in a timely fashion, it is your responsibility to email Professor Love about the situation so he can evaluate it. Such requests should be sent as soon as possible (at least 48 hours prior to the deadline) for the Deliverable, except, of course, in the case of truly horrific circumstances.
10. Grades on Deliverables are usually available one week after the submission deadline. 

## Grading Errros and Regrade Requests on Deliverables
