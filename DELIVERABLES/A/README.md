431 Deliverable A
================

**Deadline**: 2019-08-30 at 2 PM.

Deliverable A requires you to complete two activities. Completion of each activity is worth 15 points, so the maximum score is 30.

## Activity 1. Interpreting a Visualization Built in R

Professor Love used R and the `tidyverse` to build the plot below using
the `DNase` data set from the `datasets` package automatically loaded by
R.

    `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess' and formula 'y ~ x'

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png)<!-- -->

Use the Help window in R to learn about the `DNase` data set, and in
particular, about the two variables displayed in the plot and their
scientific context. Then write a paragraph (no more than 100 words)
which explains what the plot indicates about the relationship between
the two variables, and (more generally) what you have learned about the
data (or science) from the plot.

Submit your paragraph (as either a Word or PDF file) to Canvas at
<https://canvas.case.edu/> in Deliverable A.

## Activity 2. Survey

Please complete the survey form at
<http://bit.ly/431-2019-deliverableA-survey>. 

Youâ€™ll need to log into Google using your CWRU ID in order to access the form. 
The survey asks about your attitudes toward statistics, as well as for your opinion
about the most important things you learned in the first two sessions of
431. It should take about 10 minutes to complete.
