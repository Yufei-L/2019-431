## Links From Today

- [XKCD](https://xkcd.com/) is the source of many excellent comics. Today, we saw [Correlation](https://xkcd.com/552/).
- [R For Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) (often abbreviated [R4DS](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)) is an outstanding book by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham, and I used part of their Introduction to discuss Data Science ideas.
- Here's the [Wikipedia page on John Tukey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tukey) (1915-2000).
- We looked at the artificial intelligence tool for age guessing from a photograph at https://how-old.net
- We gathered our new (2019) age guessing data into the Google Sheet at http://bit.ly/431-2019-day1-ageguess
- The Hans Rosling "Joy of Stats" video we watched is at http://bit.ly/431-rosling
    - If you liked that, you might enjoy the [20-minute Ted Talk from 2007](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUwS1uAdUcI)
    - Or the [full documentary from the BBC on The Joy of Stats](https://www.gapminder.org/videos/the-joy-of-stats/)

## One Last Thing

- If you're interested in reading about a scientific model to explain the data analysis process, you might enjoy this article by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund called [A Cognitive Interpretation of Data Analysis](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/sensemaking.html).
- Interested in something a little lighter? I recommend these pieces from [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com).
    - [We Can Predict Where Measles Will Happen. Why Don’t We?](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-can-predict-where-measles-will-happen-why-dont-we/) by Maggie Koerth-Baker, 2019-06-24.
    - For a local touch, try [The Browns Are A Hot Super Bowl Pick For 2019. (Wait, What?)](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-browns-are-a-hot-super-bowl-pick-for-2019-wait-what/) from Neal Paine on 2019-07-15.
        - Of course, last year I pointed students to Neal's article from  2018-08-20, entitled: [The Browns’ Suckiness Defies Math And Reason](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-browns-suckiness-defies-math-and-reason/), so there's that.
