## Data Science

![](images/data-science-emphasize-import-and-tidy.png)


## Types of Data (Course Notes, section 4.3)

Data can be **quantitative (numerical)** or **qualitative (categorical)**

- **Quantitative**
    + Variables recorded in numbers that we use as numbers.
    + All quantitative variables must have units of measurement.
    + Can break into *continuous* (may take any value in a range) or *discrete* (limited set of potential values.)
        - Height is certainly continuous as a concept, but how precise is our ruler?
        - Piano vs. Violin
    + (less common) *interval* (equal distances between values, but zero point is arbitrary) as compared to *ratio* variables (a meaningful zero point.)
        - Is *weight* an interval or ratio variable? How about *IQ*?
    + Taking a mean or median is a reasonable idea.

## Types of Data 

Data can be **quantitative (numerical)** or **qualitative (categorical)**

- Qualitative 
    + Variables consisting of names of categories.
    + Each possible value is a code for a category (could use numerical or non-numerical codes.)
        + *Binary* categorical variables (two categories, often labeled 1 or 0)
        + *Multi-categorical* variables (usually taken to be 3+ categories)
    + Also, *nominal* (no underlying order) or *ordinal* (categories are ordered.)
        - How is your overall health? (Excellent, Very Good, Good, Fair, Poor)
        - Which candidate would you vote for if the election were held today?
        - Did this patient receive this procedure?

## Day 1 Survey Handout

![](images/day1form_2019.png)

## Evaluating some Day 1 Survey variables

1. Do you **smoke**? (1 = Non-Smoker, 2 = Former Smoker, 3 = Smoker)
2. How much did you pay for your most recent **haircut**? (in $)
3. What is your favorite **color**?
4. How many hours did you **sleep** last night?
5. Has statistical thinking been important in your life? (1 = Not at all important to 7 = Extremely important)

### Are these quantitative or qualitative?

- If quantitative, are they *discrete* or *continuous*? Do they have a meaningful *zero point*?
- If qualitative, how many categories? *Nominal* or *ordinal*?
    
## Day 1 Survey

![](images/2019_setup.png)

## Day 1 Survey

## Haircut Histogram

```{r get-data, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(survey1, aes(x = haircut)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 25, col = "white", fill = "blue") +
  annotate("text", x = 210, y = 8, label = "$210?", col="red", size = 7) +
  labs(title = "Histogram of 311 Haircut Prices from Day 1 Survey")
```

## Hand Span (in cm)

![](images/q12_outlier_2019.png) 

### Hand Span Numerical Summaries

```{r}
summary(survey1$hand.span)
```

## Hand Span (cm) Histogram

```{r, echo = F}
ggplot(data = survey1, aes(x = hand.span)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 18, col = "white", fill = "blue") +
  labs(x = "Hand Span (in cm)",
       y = "# of Students",
       title = "2014-2019 Hand Span measurements")
```

## Hand Span (cm) Histogram (Code)

```{r, eval = F}
ggplot(data = survey1, aes(x = hand.span)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 18, col = "white", fill = "blue") +
  labs(x = "Hand Span (in cm)",
       y = "# of Students",
       title = "2014-2019 Hand Span measurements")
```


## Hand Span Stem-and-Leaf, (Two digits per stem)

```{r, echo = F}
stem(survey1$hand.span, width = 60, scale = 0.5)
```

## Eight Items had just a few problems

\#  | Topic           | \#  | Topic
--: | -----------     | --: | -----------
-  | `glasses`        | -   | `lectures v activities`
Q2 | *english*      | Q10 | *projects alone*
-  | `stats so far`   | -   | `height`
Q4 | *guess TL age* | Q12 | *hand span*
-  | `smoke`          | Q13 | *color*
-  | `handedness`     | Q14 | *sleep*
-  | `stats future`   | Q15 | *pulse rate*
Q8 | *haircut*      | -   | -

Of the remaining seven items (glasses, stats so far, smoke, handedness, stats future, lectures vs activities, height), 5 had only minimal problems, and two were messy. Which two?

## Some Course Policies (1 of 2)

- Course Project (details after Labor Day)
- Quizzes (2 or 3)
- Class Participation (including TA office hours, surveys, corrections)
- Regular Deliverables (Homework)

1. Each deliverable (except A) is worth 100 points. 
2. Dr. Love will throw out your lowest score during the semester on those 100-point deliverables.
3. **Things happen**. If you have to miss a deliverable, you need to email Dr. Love as soon as possible. He will excuse the first missed deliverable (no questions asked, no details needed) but will do so only in dire circumstances otherwise. 

## Some Course Policies (2 of 2)

4. We **do not accept** deliverables that are more than an hour late, because we post answer sketches to deliverables an hour after they're due. Late = not done.
5. **Attendance** Sometimes you may need to miss a class. We don't pay attention to attendance until after Class 04, but after that,  we'd like to hear from you (no need for any details - just let us know) if you're going to miss **more than one class in a row**. Missing more than three classes over the term is a problem, and you should also email Dr. Love if that becomes necessary. You're responsible for anything you miss.
6. Want to complain about a grade? Read the last section of the Syllabus first.

## Deliverable A due Tomorrow at 2 PM

1. Review a plot I've prepared for you, using the `DNase` data set available in the automatically loaded `datasets` package in R. (You'll want to look at the Help window, and search for `DNase` to learn more about what's involved.) Submit a paragraph, as described, in Word or PDF format to Canvas.

2. Complete a (Google Form - must sign in through CWRU) survey about your attitudes toward statistics, and your thoughts on the first couple of classes. Make sure you hit the button to submit the form. (You'll receive an email confirmation.)

Deadline: 2 PM Friday. Worth 30 points. Graded exceedingly lightly.

# Using R and RStudio

## RStudio Cloud In-Class Early Project

We assume you were able to follow the software installation instructions.

If so, you'd want to:

1. Get data from our site to a new directory on your machine.
2. Open RStudio and start a new Project, in the new directory.
3. Open and set up an R Markdown file to do the work.

But, perhaps you haven't gotten to that yet. So we have RStudio Cloud.

# We Stopped Here in Class 02. We'll do the rest in Class 03.

## Analyzing the Index Card Guesses of My Age

61 students turned in an index card, meant to contain both a first and a second guess of my age. 

For the slides, I have this information in a subfolder called data in my R Project.

```{r}
love_2019 <- read_csv("data/love-age-guess-2019.csv")
```

## The `love_2019` tibble

```{r}
love_2019
```

## Histogram of initial guesses?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = love_2019, aes(x = age1)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

## Histogram of initial guesses?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = love_2019, aes(x = age1)) +
  geom_histogram()
```


## Make the width of the bins 3 years?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = love_2019, aes(x = age1)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3)
```

## Make the width of the bins 3 years?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = love_2019, aes(x = age1)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3)
```

## Fill in the bars with a better color?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = love_2019, aes(x = age1)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3, 
                 fill = "blue")
```

  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3, 
                 fill = "blue")
```

## Make it a little prettier?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = love_2019, aes(x = age1)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3, 
                 fill = "navy", color = "white")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = love_2019, aes(x = age1)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3, 
                 fill = "navy", color = "white")
```


## Add more meaningful labels?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = love_2019, aes(x = age1)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3, 
                 fill = "navy", color = "white") +
  labs(x = "First Guess of Love's Age",
       y = "# of Students",
       title = "2019 Guesses of Professor Love's Age",
       subtitle = "Actual Age was 52.5")
```

## Add more meaningful labels?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = love_2019, aes(x = age1)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3, 
                 fill = "navy", color = "white") +
  labs(x = "First Guess of Love's Age",
       y = "# of Students",
       title = "2019 Guesses of Professor Love's Age",
       subtitle = "Actual Age was 52.5")
```


## Numerical Summaries of Age Guesses

```{r}
summary(love_2019)
```

## Some Additional Summaries

```{r}
mosaic::favstats(~ age1, data = love_2019)
```

```{r}
mosaic::favstats(~ age2, data = love_2019)
```

## Another Approach

```{r}
love_2019 %>%
  skimr::skim()
```

## A Better Look

```{r, eval = F}
love_2019 %>%
  skimr::skim()
```

![](images/2019_skim_snip.png)


## What about the second guess?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = love_2019, aes(x = age2)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3, 
                 fill = "forestgreen", color = "white") +
  labs(x = "Second Guess of Love's Age",
       y = "# of Students",
       title = "2019 Guesses of Professor Love's Age",
       subtitle = "Actual Age was 52.5")
```

## What about the second guess?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = love_2019, aes(x = age2)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3, 
                 fill = "forestgreen", color = "white") +
  labs(x = "Second Guess of Love's Age",
       y = "# of Students",
       title = "2019 Guesses of Professor Love's Age",
       subtitle = "Actual Age was 52.5")
```

## Filter to complete cases only

```{r, eval = FALSE}
love_2019 %>%
  filter(complete.cases(age2)) %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = age2)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3, 
                 fill = "forestgreen", color = "white") +
  labs(x = "Second Guess of Love's Age",
       y = "# of Students",
       title = "2019 Guesses of Professor Love's Age",
       subtitle = "Actual Age was 52.5")
```

## Filter to complete cases only

```{r, echo = FALSE}
love_2019 %>%
  filter(complete.cases(age2)) %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = age2)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3, 
                 fill = "forestgreen", color = "white") +
  labs(x = "Second Guess of Love's Age",
       y = "# of Students",
       title = "2019 Guesses of Professor Love's Age",
       subtitle = "Actual Age was 52.5")
```

## Comparing First Guess to Second Guess

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = love_2019, aes(x = age1, y = age2)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Comparing First Guess to Second Guess

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = love_2019, aes(x = age1, y = age2)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Filter to complete cases, add regression line

```{r, eval = FALSE}
love_2019 %>% 
  filter(complete.cases(age1, age2)) %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = age1, y = age2)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", col = "purple")
```

## Filter to complete cases, add regression line

```{r, echo = FALSE}
love_2019 %>% 
  filter(complete.cases(age1, age2)) %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = age1, y = age2)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", col = "purple")
```

## What's that regression line?

```{r}
lm(age2 ~ age1, data = love_2019)
```

- `lm` (by default) filters to complete cases.

## How about a loess smooth curve, instead?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
love_2019 %>% 
  filter(complete.cases(age1, age2)) %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = age1, y = age2)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", col = "blue")
```

  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = age1, y = age2)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", col = "blue")
```

## Add a y = x line (no change in guess)?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
love_2019 %>% 
  filter(complete.cases(age1, age2)) %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = age1, y = age2)) +

  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, col = "red") 
```

```

## `age1 - age2` difference in guesses?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
love_2019 %>%
  mutate(diff = age1 - age2) %>%
  skimr::skim()
```

![](images/2019_skim_diff_snip.png)

## How Many Guesses Increased?

```{r}
love_2019 %>%
  mutate(diff = age1 - age2) %>%
  count(diff < 0)
```

## Increased / Stayed the Same / Decreased

```{r}
love_2019 %>%
  mutate(diff = age1 - age2) %>%
  count(sign(diff))
```

## Histogram of difference in guesses

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# Next Steps

## Analyzing the Survey Data - A little challenge

We have data on the site in a file called `surveyday1_2019.csv`. Build a project to study those data. 

Put the data in a file called `survey1` in R. 

- I'd call my R Markdown file `day1surveyanalysis`

Can you reproduce the following...

## A. That fill color is called *salmon*, I used 20 bins.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(survey1, aes(x = pulse)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 20, col = "blue", fill = "salmon") +
    labs(x = "Pulse Rate of 313 students in 431", 
         y = "# of Students",
         title = "Pulse Rates of 313 students in 431",
         subtitle = "Two students had missing pulse values")
```

## Code for Part A.

```{r, eval = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(survey1, aes(x = pulse)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 20, col = "blue", fill = "salmon") +
    labs(x = "Pulse Rate of 313 students in 431", 
         y = "# of Students",
         title = "Pulse Rates of 313 students in 431",
         subtitle = "Two students had missing pulse values")
```

## B. Histograms of Pulse Rates, Faceted by Year

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(survey1, aes(x = pulse, fill = year)) + 
    geom_histogram(bins = 15, col = "white") + 
    facet_wrap(~ year) +
    guides(fill = FALSE) +
    labs(title = "Pulse Rate, by Year")
```

## Code for Plot B.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(survey1, aes(x = pulse, fill = year)) + 
    geom_histogram(bins = 15, col = "white") + 
    facet_wrap(~ year) +
    guides(fill = FALSE) +
    labs(title = "Pulse Rate, by Year")
```


## C. Boxplots of Age Guesses, by Year

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(survey1, aes(x = factor(year), y = ageguess, 
                    fill = factor(year))) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Age Guess, by Year")
```

## Code for Plot C

```{r , eval = FALSE}
ggplot(survey1, aes(x = factor(year), y = ageguess, 
                    fill = factor(year))) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Age Guess, by Year")
```

## Summary Table of Age Guesses, by Year

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
survey1 %>%
    group_by(year) %>%
    summarize(n = n(),
              mean = mean(ageguess, na.rm=TRUE), 
              sd = sd(ageguess, na.rm=TRUE), 
              median = median(ageguess, na.rm=TRUE) 
              )
```

## Code for Summary Table

```{r, eval = FALSE}
survey1 %>%
    group_by(year) %>%
    summarize(n = n(),
              mean = mean(ageguess, na.rm=TRUE), 
              sd = sd(ageguess, na.rm=TRUE), 
              median = median(ageguess, na.rm=TRUE) 
              )
```
