## Today's Slides

- Class 4 slides will be available in [PDF format](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/CLASSES/CLASS04/431_class-04-slides_2019.pdf), as well as in [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/CLASSES/CLASS04/431_class-04-slides_2019.Rmd) above by the time class starts. Again, we'll be doing some live coding in RStudio Cloud.
- Audio recordings of all Classes are posted to http://bit.ly/431-2019-audio as they become available, usually that same day.
- To get help, [visit TA office hours](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/calendar.md#ta-office-hours), visit with Dr. Love before or after class, or email `431-help at case dot edu`. Thanks!

## Upcoming Deliverables

1. [Homework B](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/tree/master/HOMEWORK/B) is due Friday 2019-09-06 at 2 PM.
2. Please [join the RStudio Cloud](http://bit.ly/431-2019-join-cloud) as soon as possible. Visit http://bit.ly/431-2019-join-cloud to do so.
    - One of the best parts of RStudio Cloud is the set of **primers** available there. While all of them are useful, we especially recommend the four highlighted below for people new to R or needing a brush-up on the tidyverse.
