    - Again, we'll be doing some live coding in RStudio Cloud.
- Audio recordings of all Classes are posted to http://bit.ly/431-2019-audio as they become available.
- To get help from us, [visit TA office hours](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/calendar.md#ta-office-hours), visit with Dr. Love before or after class, or email `431-help at case dot edu`.

## Today is 2019-09-05. Why does Dr. Love write it that way?

## Things You Need to be Working On

1. [Homework B](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/tree/master/HOMEWORK/B) is due Friday 2019-09-06 at 2 PM.
2. Please [join the RStudio Cloud](http://bit.ly/431-2019-join-cloud) as soon as possible at http://bit.ly/431-2019-join-cloud.
    - While all of their primers are useful, we especially recommend the four highlighted below for people new to R or needing a brush-up on the tidyverse.

3. By 2019-09-10 you should have read **Leek** Chapters 5, 9, 10 and 13 (although the book is very short - you might prefer to simply read it all). By 2019-09-17 you should have read **Silver** Introduction and Chapter 1, too.
4. [Homework C](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/tree/master/HOMEWORK/C) is due Friday 2019-09-13 at 2 PM.

## Pep Talk! (Thanks, [Andrew Heiss](https://evalf19.classes.andrewheiss.com/syllabus/#pep-talk))

*Note* This is also on the front page of the course.

Learning R can be difficult at first - it’s like learning a new lanugage, just like Spanish, French, or Chinese. Hadley Wickham—the chief data scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you’ll be using like `ggplot2` [made this wise observation](https://r-posts.com/advice-to-young-and-old-programmers-a-conversation-with-hadley-wickham/):

> It’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.

If you’re finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, visit [TA office hours](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/calendar.md#ta-office-hours), ask questions at `431-help at case dot edu`, etc.

We promise you can do this.

## Announcements

1. The DELIVERABLES section is dead. Everything is now posted instead to [the HOMEWORK section](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/tree/master/HOMEWORK). 
    - While I believe I've repaired many of the old links to "Deliverables", if you find any, please let us know.
    - The form to fill out if you want to complain about grading on the Homework **will be posted**.
2. Grades and our comments on Homework A have been posted to the grading roster at http://bit.ly/431-2019-grades. You'll need the HW ID code I emailed to you today. The regrade request form is also available now at http://bit.ly/431-2019-regrade-requests. All regrade requests need to be submitted by 2019-12-12 at noon. See the [last section of the Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-431-syllabus/general-course-policies.html#grade-appeal-policy---request-a-review-in-december) for more on this policy.
3. Comments from Professor Love in reaction to the Minute Paper after Class 03 **will be posted**.


## One last thing

- [Explaining histograms](https://tinlizzie.org/histograms/) is an amazing essay by Aran Lunzer and Amelia McNamara. You owe it to yourself to take a look.
