## Today's Agenda

Using R, RStudio and R Markdown and the 431 RStudio Cloud

Contact us at \color{blue} `431-help@case.edu` \color{black}

Our web site: \color{blue} https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431 \color{black}


## A Worked Day 1 Survey Analysis

We have data on the site in a file called `surveyday1_2019.csv`. I built a R Markdown file, and then knitted it into an a PDF and an HTML then posted links to the Class 04 README.

- A "floating" table of contents
- Key verbs in the tidyverse for data wrangling
  - select, filter, count, arrange, mutate, group_by, summarize
- Building Histograms to describe a single quantitative variable
- Comparing a distribution of a quantity within groups
  - Faceted histogram
  - Comparison boxplot
- Obtaining numerical summaries
- Scatterplots with `ggplot`

All of this is also in the Course Notes.

## Analyzing the Day 1 Survey

Load the R Packages we need

```{r load_packages, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(magrittr); library(tidyverse)
## always need tidyverse, can include other packages too
```

## Analyzing the Day 1 Survey

Load the Data

We will read in the .csv file of the data, and then pipe that result into the `tbl_df` function, which turns the data frame into a nicely organized *tibble*. 

- Since we've stored the data file in the same directory as our R Project, we can read it in directly.

```{r load_data}
day1 <- read.csv("surveyday1_2019.csv") %>% tbl_df
```

## Print your tibble by typing its name

```{r}
day1
```

## Use **select** to pick columns / variables from your tibble

```{r}
day1 %>%
    select(favcolor, haircut)
```

## Use **filter** to pick rows / subjects from your tibble

```{r}
day1 %>%
    filter(year == 2019)
```

## Use **count** to count the number of observations meeting a criterion

```{r}
day1 %>%
    count(favcolor == "red")
```

## Or to provide a cross-classification:

```{r}
day1 %>%
    count(favcolor == "blue", factor(english))
```

## Use **arrange** to arrange the rows of a tibble

```{r}
day1 %>%
    count(statsofar) %>%
    arrange(desc(n))
```

## Add new variables with **mutate**

```{r}
day1 %>%
    mutate(guess_error = ageguess - lovetrueage) %>%
    select(ageguess, lovetrueage, guess_error) %>%
    summary()
```

## Get grouped summaries with **group_by** and **summarize**

```{r}
day1 %>%
    group_by(year) %>%
    summarize(n = n(), average_guess = mean(ageguess),
              min_error = min(ageguess),
              max_error = max(ageguess),
              actual = mean(lovetrueage)) 
```

## Dealing with Missingness

We could filter our data to only include the subjects who provided a guess...

```{r}
day1 %>%
    filter(complete.cases(ageguess)) %>%
    group_by(year) %>%
    summarize(n = n(), average_guess = mean(ageguess),
              min_error = min(ageguess),
              max_error = max(ageguess),
              actual = mean(lovetrueage)) 
```

## Looking at Errors, instead

What if, instead, we wanted to look at the errors made, by subtracting off my true age from everyone's guess?

```{r}
day1 %>%
    filter(complete.cases(ageguess)) %>%
    mutate(guess_error = ageguess - lovetrueage) %>%
    group_by(year) %>%
    summarize(n = n(), average_error = mean(guess_error),
              min_error = min(guess_error),
              max_error = max(guess_error))
```


## Histogram of Haircut Prices

```{r, eval = F}
ggplot(data = day1, aes(x = haircut)) +
    geom_histogram()
```

## Histogram of Haircut Prices (Result)

```{r, echo = F}
ggplot(data = day1, aes(x = haircut)) +
    geom_histogram()
```

## Improvements

1. We'll filter the rows of the `day1` tibble to include only those subjects who gave us a haircut price.

```{r}
day1 %>% 
    filter(complete.cases(haircut)) %>%
    ggplot(data = ., aes(x = haircut)) +
    geom_histogram()
```

---

```{r, echo = FALSE}
day1 %>% 
    filter(complete.cases(haircut)) %>%
    ggplot(data = ., aes(x = haircut)) +
    geom_histogram()
```



## Improvements

2. We'll specify that R should create bins of width $10 (rather than the default, which creates 30 bins) for the haircut prices to fall in.

```{r}
day1 %>% 
    filter(complete.cases(haircut)) %>%
    ggplot(data = ., aes(x = haircut)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 10)
```

---

```{r, echo = FALSE}
day1 %>% 
    filter(complete.cases(haircut)) %>%
    ggplot(data = ., aes(x = haircut)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 10)
```

## Improvements

3. We'll set the fill to be a better color - a nice resource for this is to google **Colors in R**. I'll pick "slateblue". We'll also color the outlines of the bars "white".

```{r}
day1 %>% 
    filter(complete.cases(haircut)) %>%
    ggplot(data = ., aes(x = haircut)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, 
                   fill = "slateblue", col = "white")
```

---

```{r, echo = FALSE}
day1 %>% 
    filter(complete.cases(haircut)) %>%
    ggplot(data = ., aes(x = haircut)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, 
                   fill = "slateblue", col = "white")
```

## Improvements

4. We'll build a main title, subtitle and proper axis titles.

```{r}
day1 %>% 
    filter(complete.cases(haircut)) %>%
    ggplot(data = ., aes(x = haircut)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, 
                   fill = "slateblue", col = "white") +
    labs(x = "Price of Most Recent Haircut in $",
         y = "Number of Students",
         title = "Histogram of Haircut Prices",
         subtitle = "431 students from 2014 - 2019")
```

## Result?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
day1 %>% 
    filter(complete.cases(haircut)) %>%
    ggplot(data = ., aes(x = haircut)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, 
                   fill = "slateblue", col = "white") +
    labs(x = "Price of Most Recent Haircut in $",
         y = "Number of Students",
         title = "Histogram of Haircut Prices",
         subtitle = "431 students from 2014 - 2019")
```

## Separate histograms for each year with faceting?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
day1 %>%
    filter(!is.na(haircut)) %>%
    ggplot(., aes(x = haircut)) +
        geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, 
                       fill = "slateblue", color = "white") +
        guides(fill = FALSE) +
        labs(x = "Price of Last Haircut in $", 
        		 y = "Number of Students") +
        facet_wrap(~ year)
```

## Resulting (using `facet_wrap`) plot

```{r, echo = FALSE}
day1 %>%
    filter(!is.na(haircut)) %>%
    ggplot(., aes(x = haircut)) +
        geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, 
                       fill = "slateblue", color = "white") +
        guides(fill = FALSE) +
        labs(x = "Price of Last Haircut in $", 
        		 y = "Number of Students") +
        facet_wrap(~ year)
```

## Building a Comparison Boxplot

We could use a comparison boxplot. A trick here is to specify `year` as a factor...

```{r, eval = F}
day1 %>%
    filter(complete.cases(haircut)) %>%
    ggplot(data = ., 
           aes(x = factor(year), y = haircut)) +
    geom_boxplot()
```

## Comparison Boxplot

```{r, echo = F}
day1 %>%
    filter(complete.cases(haircut)) %>%
    ggplot(data = ., 
           aes(x = factor(year), y = haircut)) +
    geom_boxplot()
```

## Detailed Numerical Summary of Haircut Prices

```{r}
day1 %>%
    select(haircut) %>%
    summary()
```

which can also be done with

```{r, eval = FALSE}
summary(day1$haircut)
```

## The `mosaic` package has a useful `favstats` function...

```{r, eval = F}
mosaic::favstats(day1$haircut)
```

But to get this in a pipeline, you'd need the `%$%` operator from the `magrittr` package...

```{r}
day1 %$%
    mosaic::favstats(haircut)
```

## The `psych` package has a useful `describe` function...

```{r}
day1 %$%
    psych::describe(haircut)
```

## The `Hmisc` package also has a useful `describe` function...

```{r}
day1 %$%
    Hmisc::describe(haircut)
```

## Numerical Summary by Year?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
day1 %>% 
    filter(!is.na(haircut)) %>%
    group_by(year) %>%
    summarize(n = n(), mean = mean(haircut), 
              sd = sd(haircut), median = median(haircut))
```

## Numerical Summary by Year (Result)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
day1 %>% 
    filter(!is.na(haircut)) %>%
    group_by(year) %>%
    summarize(n = n(), mean = mean(haircut), 
              sd = sd(haircut), median = median(haircut))
```

## What is the relationship between 431 students' pulse rate and hours of sleep the prior night?

Here, we're looking at two quantitative variables. A **scatterplot** is usually the best choice.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = day1, aes(x = lastsleep, y = pulse)) +
    geom_point()
```

## Scatterplot (Result)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = day1, aes(x = lastsleep, y = pulse)) +
    geom_point()
```

## Improving the Scatterplot

Let's filter to include only those cases with known `pulse` and known `lastsleep`, and also add a line from a linear regression model to predict pulse rate on the basis of hours of sleep the prior night.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
day1 %>%
    filter(complete.cases(pulse, lastsleep)) %>%
    ggplot(data = ., aes(x = lastsleep, y = pulse)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, col = "red")
```

---

```{r, echo = FALSE}
day1 %>%
    filter(complete.cases(pulse, lastsleep)) %>%
    ggplot(data = ., aes(x = lastsleep, y = pulse)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, col = "red")
```

## Smoothing the 2019 data

Let's look at the 2019 data only, and fit a curved (loess) smooth to predict pulse rate on the basis of hours of sleep the prior night. We'll also add a title and subtitle and retitle the axes

```{r, eval = FALSE}
day1 %>%
    filter(year == "2019") %>%
    filter(complete.cases(pulse, lastsleep)) %>%
    ggplot(data = ., aes(x = lastsleep, y = pulse)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "loess") +
    labs(title = "Pulse Rate as a Function of Hours of Sleep Last Night",
         subtitle = "with fitted loess smooth, students in the 2019 class",
         x = "Hours of Sleep Last Night",
         y = "Pulse Rate in Class Today")
```

## The Results

```{r, echo = FALSE}
day1 %>%
    filter(year == "2019") %>%
    filter(complete.cases(pulse, lastsleep)) %>%
    ggplot(data = ., aes(x = lastsleep, y = pulse)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "loess") +
    labs(title = "Pulse Rate as a Function of Hours of Sleep Last Night",
         subtitle = "with fitted loess smooth, students in the 2019 class",
         x = "Hours of Sleep Last Night",
         y = "Pulse Rate in Class Today")
```


## A Linear Model?

We could instead restrict ourselves to a linear model for the 2019 group.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
day1 %>%
    filter(year == "2019") %>%
    filter(complete.cases(pulse, lastsleep)) %>%
    ggplot(data = ., aes(x = lastsleep, y = pulse)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", col = "red") +
    labs(title = "Pulse Rate as a Function of Hours of Sleep Last Night",
         subtitle = "with fitted linear model, students in the 2019 class",
         x = "Hours of Sleep Last Night",
         y = "Pulse Rate in Class Today")
```

## Linear Fit (Results)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
day1 %>%
    filter(year == "2019") %>%
    filter(complete.cases(pulse, lastsleep)) %>%
    ggplot(data = ., aes(x = lastsleep, y = pulse)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", col = "red") +
    labs(title = "Pulse Rate as a Function of Hours of Sleep Last Night",
         subtitle = "with fitted linear model, students in the 2019 class",
         x = "Hours of Sleep Last Night",
         y = "Pulse Rate in Class Today")
```

## Correlation?

The correlation of `lastsleep` and `pulse` is likely to be of some interest. Note the use of both the `%>%` and `%$%` pipes in this case.

```{r}
day1 %>%
    filter(year == "2019") %>%
    filter(complete.cases(pulse, lastsleep)) %$%
    cor(pulse, lastsleep)
```


## Does the linear model change much by year?

Here's the plot, color coding the models by year (note the use of the group as well as the color aesthetic here), and also incorporating the black-and-white theme, rather than the default.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
day1 %>%
    filter(complete.cases(pulse, lastsleep)) %>%
    ggplot(., aes(x = lastsleep, y = pulse, 
    							color = factor(year),
    							group = factor(year))) +
    geom_point() + 
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
	  theme_bw()
```

## Does the linear model change much by year?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
day1 %>%
    filter(complete.cases(pulse, lastsleep)) %>%
    ggplot(., aes(x = lastsleep, y = pulse, 
    							color = factor(year),
    							group = factor(year))) +
    geom_point() + 
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
	  theme_bw()
```

## Plot of the models only

Here's the same plot of the models alone, and not showing the data (commenting out the line of code that draws the points.) We'll also improve the labeling.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
day1 %>%
    filter(complete.cases(pulse, lastsleep)) %>%
    ggplot(., aes(x = lastsleep, y = pulse, 
    							color = factor(year),
    							group = factor(year))) +
 #   geom_point() + 
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
    labs(title = "Pulse Rate and Hours of Sleep, 2014-2019",
         x = "Hours of Sleep Last Night",
         y = "Pulse Rate in Class Today") +
	  theme_bw()
```

## Plot of the models only

```{r, echo = FALSE}
day1 %>%
    filter(complete.cases(pulse, lastsleep)) %>%
    ggplot(., aes(x = lastsleep, y = pulse, 
    							color = factor(year),
    							group = factor(year))) +
 #   geom_point() + 
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
    labs(title = "Pulse Rate and Hours of Sleep, 2014-2019",
         x = "Hours of Sleep Last Night",
         y = "Pulse Rate in Class Today") +
	  theme_bw()
```

## Faceting a Scatterplot

Here's the same basic information, but faceted by year.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
day1 %>%
    filter(complete.cases(pulse, lastsleep)) %>%
    ggplot(data = ., aes(x = lastsleep, y = pulse, 
    							group = factor(year))) +
    geom_point() + 
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red") +
    facet_wrap(~ year) +
    labs(title = "Pulse Rate and Hours of Sleep, 2014-2019",
         x = "Hours of Sleep Last Night",
         y = "Pulse Rate in Class Today") +
    theme_bw()
```

## Faceting a Scatterplot

```{r, echo = FALSE}
day1 %>%
    filter(complete.cases(pulse, lastsleep)) %>%
    ggplot(data = ., aes(x = lastsleep, y = pulse, 
    							group = factor(year))) +
    geom_point() + 
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "red") +
    facet_wrap(~ year) +
    labs(title = "Pulse Rate and Hours of Sleep, 2014-2019",
         x = "Hours of Sleep Last Night",
         y = "Pulse Rate in Class Today") +
    theme_bw()
```

## Analyzing the Survey Data - A little challenge

Can you reproduce the following...

## A. That fill color is called *salmon*, I used 20 bins.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
day1 %>% filter(complete.cases(pulse)) %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = pulse)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, col = "blue", fill = "salmon") +
  labs(x = "Pulse Rate of 313 students in 431", 
       y = "# of Students",
       title = "Pulse Rates of 313 students in 431",
       subtitle = "Two students had missing pulse values")
```

## Code for Part A.

```{r, eval = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
day1 %>% filter(complete.cases(pulse)) %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = pulse)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, col = "blue", fill = "salmon") +
  labs(x = "Pulse Rate of 313 students in 431", 
       y = "# of Students",
       title = "Pulse Rates of 313 students in 431",
       subtitle = "Two students had missing pulse values")
```

## B. Histograms of Pulse Rates, Faceted by Year

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
day1 %>% filter(complete.cases(pulse)) %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = pulse, fill = year)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 15, col = "white") + 
  facet_wrap(~ year) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Pulse Rate, by Year")
```

## Code for Plot B.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
day1 %>% filter(complete.cases(pulse)) %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = pulse, fill = year)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 15, col = "white") + 
  facet_wrap(~ year) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Pulse Rate, by Year")
```


## C. Boxplots of Age Guesses, by Year

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
day1 %>% filter(complete.cases(ageguess)) %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = factor(year), y = ageguess, 
                    fill = factor(year))) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Age Guess, by Year")
```

## Code for Plot C

```{r , eval = FALSE}
day1 %>% filter(complete.cases(ageguess)) %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = factor(year), y = ageguess, 
                    fill = factor(year))) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Age Guess, by Year")
```

## Summary Table of Age Guesses, by Year

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
day1 %>%
  filter(complete.cases(ageguess)) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(n = n(),
            mean = mean(ageguess, na.rm=TRUE), 
            sd = sd(ageguess, na.rm=TRUE), 
            median = median(ageguess, na.rm=TRUE) 
            )
```

## Code for Summary Table

```{r, eval = FALSE}
day1 %>%
  filter(complete.cases(ageguess)) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(n = n(),
            mean = mean(ageguess, na.rm=TRUE),

            median = median(ageguess, na.rm=TRUE) 
            )
```
