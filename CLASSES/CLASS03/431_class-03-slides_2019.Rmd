## Today's Agenda

Using R, RStudio and R Markdown and the 431 RStudio Cloud

Contact us at \color{blue} `431-help@case.edu` \color{black}

Our web site: \color{blue} https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431 \color{black}

## RStudio Cloud In-Class Early Project

We assume you were able to follow the software installation instructions.

If so, you'd want to:

1. Get data from our site to a new directory on your machine.
2. Open RStudio and start a new Project, in the new directory.
3. Open and set up an R Markdown file to do the work.

But, perhaps you haven't gotten to that yet. So we have RStudio Cloud.

Link to join is: \color{blue} http://bit.ly/431-2019-join-cloud \color{black}

## First Step: Load the Packages You Need

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Analyzing the Index Card Guesses of My Age

61 students turned in an index card, meant to contain both a first and a second guess of my age. 

For the slides, I have this information in a subfolder called data in my R Project.

```{r}
love_2019 <- read_csv("data/love-age-guess-2019.csv")
```

## The `love_2019` tibble

```{r}
love_2019
```

## Histogram of initial guesses?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = love_2019, aes(x = age1)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

## Histogram of initial guesses?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = love_2019, aes(x = age1)) +
  geom_histogram()
```


## Make the width of the bins 3 years?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = love_2019, aes(x = age1)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3)
```

## Make the width of the bins 3 years?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = love_2019, aes(x = age1)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3)
```

## Fill in the bars with a better color?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = love_2019, aes(x = age1)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3, 
                 fill = "blue")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = love_2019, aes(x = age1)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3, 
                 fill = "blue")
```

## Make it a little prettier?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = love_2019, aes(x = age1)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3, 
                 fill = "navy", color = "white")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = love_2019, aes(x = age1)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3, 
                 fill = "navy", color = "white")
```


## Add more meaningful labels?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = love_2019, aes(x = age1)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3, 
                 fill = "navy", color = "white") +
  labs(x = "First Guess of Love's Age",
       y = "# of Students",
       title = "2019 Guesses of Professor Love's Age",
       subtitle = "Actual Age was 52.5")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = love_2019, aes(x = age1)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3, 
                 fill = "navy", color = "white") +
  labs(x = "First Guess of Love's Age",
       y = "# of Students",
       title = "2019 Guesses of Professor Love's Age",
       subtitle = "Actual Age was 52.5")
```


## Numerical Summaries of Age Guesses

```{r}
summary(love_2019)
```

## Some Additional Summaries

```{r}
mosaic::favstats(~ age1, data = love_2019)
```

```{r}
mosaic::favstats(~ age2, data = love_2019)
```

## Another Approach

```{r}
love_2019 %>%
  skimr::skim()
```

## A Better Look

```{r, eval = F}
love_2019 %>%
  skimr::skim()
```

## What about the second guess?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = love_2019, aes(x = age2)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3, 
                 fill = "forestgreen", color = "white") +
  labs(x = "Second Guess of Love's Age",
       y = "# of Students",
       title = "2019 Guesses of Professor Love's Age",
       subtitle = "Actual Age was 52.5")
```

## What about the second guess?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = love_2019, aes(x = age2)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3, 
                 fill = "forestgreen", color = "white") +
  labs(x = "Second Guess of Love's Age",
       y = "# of Students",
       title = "2019 Guesses of Professor Love's Age",
       subtitle = "Actual Age was 52.5")
```

## Filter to complete cases only

```{r, eval = FALSE}
love_2019 %>%
  filter(complete.cases(age2)) %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = age2)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3, 
                 fill = "forestgreen", color = "white") +
  labs(x = "Second Guess of Love's Age",
       y = "# of Students",
       title = "2019 Guesses of Professor Love's Age",
       subtitle = "Actual Age was 52.5")
```

## Filter to complete cases only

```{r, echo = FALSE}
love_2019 %>%
  filter(complete.cases(age2)) %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = age2)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 3, 
                 fill = "forestgreen", color = "white") +
  labs(x = "Second Guess of Love's Age",
       y = "# of Students",
       title = "2019 Guesses of Professor Love's Age",
       subtitle = "Actual Age was 52.5")
```

## Comparing First Guess to Second Guess

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = love_2019, aes(x = age1, y = age2)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Comparing First Guess to Second Guess

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = love_2019, aes(x = age1, y = age2)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Filter to complete cases, add regression line

```{r, eval = FALSE}
love_2019 %>% 
  filter(complete.cases(age1, age2)) %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = age1, y = age2)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", col = "purple")
```

## Filter to complete cases, add regression line

```{r, echo = FALSE}
love_2019 %>% 
  filter(complete.cases(age1, age2)) %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = age1, y = age2)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", col = "purple")
```

## What's that regression line?

```{r}
lm(age2 ~ age1, data = love_2019)
```

- `lm` (by default) filters to complete cases.

## How about a loess smooth curve, instead?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
love_2019 %>% 
  filter(complete.cases(age1, age2)) %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = age1, y = age2)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", col = "blue")
```

## How about a loess smooth curve, instead?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
love_2019 %>% 
  filter(complete.cases(age1, age2)) %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = age1, y = age2)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", col = "blue")
```

## Add a y = x line (no change in guess)?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
love_2019 %>% 
  filter(complete.cases(age1, age2)) %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = age1, y = age2)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", col = "blue") +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, col = "red") 
```

## Add a y = x line (no change in guess)?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
love_2019 %>% 
  filter(complete.cases(age1, age2)) %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = age1, y = age2)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", col = "blue") +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, col = "red") 
```

  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", col = "blue") +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, col = "red") +
  geom_text(x = 60, y = 62, 
            label = "y = x", col = "red") +
  labs(x = "First Guess of Love's Age",
       y = "Second Guess of Love's Age",
       title = "Comparing 2019 Age Guesses",
       subtitle = "Love's actual age = 52.5")
```

            label = "y = x", col = "red") +
  labs(x = "First Guess of Love's Age",
       y = "Second Guess of Love's Age",
       title = "Comparing 2019 Age Guesses",
       subtitle = "Love's actual age = 52.5")
```

## `age1 - age2` difference in guesses?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
love_2019 %>%
  mutate(diff = age1 - age2) %>%
  skimr::skim()
```

![](images/2019_skim_diff_snip.png)

## How Many Guesses Increased?

```{r}
love_2019 %>%
  mutate(diff = age1 - age2) %>%
  count(diff < 0)
```

## Increased / Stayed the Same / Decreased

```{r}
love_2019 %>%
  mutate(diff = age1 - age2) %>%
  count(sign(diff))
```

## Histogram of difference in guesses

```{r, eval = FALSE}
love_2019 %>%
  mutate(diff = age1 - age2) %>%
  filter(complete.cases(diff)) %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = diff)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, 
                 fill = "royalblue", color = "yellow") +
  labs(x = "Change in Guess of Love's Age")
```

                 fill = "royalblue", color = "yellow") +
  labs(x = "Change in Guess of Love's Age")
```

## Analyzing the Survey Data - A little challenge

We have data on the site in a file called `surveyday1_2019.csv`. Build a project to study those data. 

Put the data in a file called `survey1` in R. 

- I'd call my R Markdown file `day1surveyanalysis`

Can you reproduce the following...

## A. That fill color is called *salmon*, I used 20 bins.

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
survey1 <- read_csv("data/surveyday1_2019.csv") 

survey1 %>% filter(complete.cases(pulse)) %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = pulse)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, col = "blue", fill = "salmon") +
  labs(x = "Pulse Rate of 313 students in 431", 
       y = "# of Students",
       title = "Pulse Rates of 313 students in 431",
       subtitle = "Two students had missing pulse values")
```

## Code for Part A.

```{r, eval = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
survey1 <- read_csv("data/surveyday1_2019.csv") 

survey1 %>% filter(complete.cases(pulse)) %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = pulse)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, col = "blue", fill = "salmon") +
  labs(x = "Pulse Rate of 313 students in 431", 
       y = "# of Students",
       title = "Pulse Rates of 313 students in 431",
       subtitle = "Two students had missing pulse values")
```

## B. Histograms of Pulse Rates, Faceted by Year

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
survey1 %>% filter(complete.cases(pulse)) %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = pulse, fill = year)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 15, col = "white") + 
  facet_wrap(~ year) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Pulse Rate, by Year")
```

## Code for Plot B.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
survey1 %>% filter(complete.cases(pulse)) %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = pulse, fill = year)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 15, col = "white") + 
  facet_wrap(~ year) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Pulse Rate, by Year")
```


## C. Boxplots of Age Guesses, by Year

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
survey1 %>% filter(complete.cases(ageguess)) %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = factor(year), y = ageguess, 
                    fill = factor(year))) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Age Guess, by Year")
```

## Code for Plot C

```{r , eval = FALSE}
survey1 %>% filter(complete.cases(ageguess)) %>%
  ggplot(data = ., aes(x = factor(year), y = ageguess, 
                    fill = factor(year))) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Age Guess, by Year")
```

## Summary Table of Age Guesses, by Year

```{r, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
survey1 %>%
  filter(complete.cases(ageguess)) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(n = n(),
            mean = mean(ageguess, na.rm=TRUE), 
            sd = sd(ageguess, na.rm=TRUE), 
            median = median(ageguess, na.rm=TRUE) 
            )
```

## Code for Summary Table

```{r, eval = FALSE}
survey1 %>%
  filter(complete.cases(ageguess)) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(n = n(),
            mean = mean(ageguess, na.rm=TRUE), 
            sd = sd(ageguess, na.rm=TRUE), 
            median = median(ageguess, na.rm=TRUE) 
            )
```
