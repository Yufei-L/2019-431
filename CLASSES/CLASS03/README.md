# 431 Fall 2019 Class 03: 2019-09-03

## Today's Slides

- Class 3 slides (in draft form) are now available in [PDF format](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/CLASSES/CLASS03/431_class-03-slides_2019.pdf), as well as in [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/CLASSES/CLASS03/431_class-03-slides_2019.Rmd) above, but we'll be doing some live coding in RStudio during class, so it's quite possible that we'll wander away from the script in places, during class, in which case, I'll post more after class.
- Audio recordings of all Class sessions are posted to http://bit.ly/431-2019-audio as they become available.
- To get help, [visit TA office hours](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/calendar.md#ta-office-hours), visit with Dr. Love before or after class, or email `431-help at case dot edu`. Thanks!

## Upcoming Deliverables

1. There is a Minute Paper due after today's class. **Link to come.** Please submit the form by 2 PM Wednesday.

## Announcements

1. Office Hours for TAs began this morning. The schedule is posted at [the bottom of the Course Calendar](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/calendar.md#ta-office-hours).
2. I am in the midst of changing the names of what I used to call "Deliverables" to "Homeworks" because that's more sensible, but it's going to take me a couple of days to make that change.
  - After Thursday, if you find old (now dead) links, please email us at `431-help` for a bit of class participation credit.
3. The [Answer Sketch for Homework A](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/tree/master/DELIVERABLES/A) (formerly called Deliverable A) is now available, in both PDF and R Markdown formats. 
  - You should receive your grades and some feedback on your paragraph from Homework A on Thursday.
  - I have compiled the results of the Homework A survey form at **link to come**.
5. There is a document that is part of the Software materials (also our Data and Code) called **Getting Started with R**, available [in R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/SOFTWARE/431-getting-started-with-R.Rmd) and [in PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/SOFTWARE/431-getting-started-with-R.pdf) formats. We'll spend a little time with it today, but it's meant to be something you can work through on your own. 
  - This provides a worked example of using R Markdown to process a document (the R Markdown version) into a knitted file (HTML or PDF, for instance) combining results and code.
  - The examples explore (1) some data from an experiment on the growth rate of chickens in response to several different feed supplements, and then (2) some data on the growth of orange trees.
6. I now expect to get complete [Course Project](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/tree/master/PROJECT) information to you by Tuesday 2019-09-10. If you have questions in the interim, please ask them at 431-help.
