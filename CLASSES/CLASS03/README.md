# 431 Fall 2019 Class 03: 2019-09-03

## Today's Slides

- Class 3 slides (in draft form) are now available in [PDF format](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/CLASSES/CLASS03/431_class-03-slides_2019.pdf), as well as in [R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/CLASSES/CLASS03/431_class-03-slides_2019.Rmd) above, but we'll be doing some live coding in RStudio during class, so it's quite possible that we'll wander away from the script in places, during class, in which case, I'll post more after class.
- Audio recordings of all Classes are posted to http://bit.ly/431-2019-audio as they become available.
- To get help, [visit TA office hours](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/calendar.md#ta-office-hours), visit with Dr. Love before or after class, or email `431-help at case dot edu`. Thanks!

## Upcoming Deliverables

1. Please [join the RStudio Cloud](http://bit.ly/431-2019-join-cloud) as soon as possible. Visit http://bit.ly/431-2019-join-cloud to do so.
    - One of the best parts of RStudio Cloud is the set of primers available there. We heartily recommend **all of them** for those of you who have specific areas where you're looking for help.
2. There is a *Minute Paper* after today's class, as there will be most weeks. **Link to come.** Please submit the form by 2 PM on Wednesday 2019-09-03, although you would ideally fill it out at the end of class. It should take 2-3 minutes. 
    - Completing the form boosts your Class Participation grade, which starts at 60% and can only increase through the semester.
    - It will ask you whether you've joined the RStudio Cloud, and if so, it will ask for your RStudio Cloud user name.
3. [Homework B](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/tree/master/DELIVERABLES/B) is due on Friday 2019-09-06 at 2 PM.

## Get help at any time by emailing **431-help at case dot edu**.

1. Apply the 15-minute rule. If you can't solve a problem in 15 minutes, **ask for help** either from us or from Google.
    - You are **absolutely supposed** to use Google and the TAs (and Dr. Love) to improve your code.
2. When asking for help with an R problem from **431-help at case dot edu**, we ask you to try to make it easier for us to help you. Specifically...
    - attach a copy of the R Markdown file you are working on, (or better still, point us to it on RStudio Cloud)
    - include a screenshot or copy-and-paste listing of the error you are generating, if that's the problem.
    - attach a copy of the data set (if it's not about a homework assignment or other data set that we gave you),
    - attach a copy of the HTML result (if you can create it).

With the R Markdown file, and a detailed explanation of the problem you see, we can often solve the problem in a single email. Without the R Markdown file, we can rarely do anything except ask more questions.

3. When you get a response from one of us on **431-help at case dot edu** you'll notice we REPLY ALL so that all of the TAs (and Dr. Love) can see the result. If you need to respond, please fight your usual urge and **REPLY ALL** as well so that we can all still help. You want to be sure that `431-help at case dot edu` is in the list of recipients of each of your emails, even though replies will come from individuals.

## Announcements

1. Teaching Assistant Office Hours began this morning and are held in WG-56 (Computing Lab) or WG-67 (Student Lounge) on the ground floor of the Wood building, so be sure to look in both places. The schedule is posted at [the bottom of the Course Calendar](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/calendar.md#ta-office-hours).
2. I am in the midst of changing the names of what I used to call "Deliverables" to "Homeworks" because that's more sensible, but it's going to take me a couple of days to make that change.
    - After Thursday, if you find old (now dead) links, please email us at `431-help` for a bit of class participation credit.
    - In a similar vein, Please help us **kill typos**, by emailing 431-help (or Dr. Love directly) whenever and wherever you find them.
3. The [Answer Sketch for Homework A](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/tree/master/DELIVERABLES/A) (formerly called Deliverable A) is now available, in both PDF and R Markdown formats. 
    - You should receive your grades and some feedback on your paragraph from Homework A on Thursday.
    - I have compiled the results of the Homework A survey form at **link to come**.
4. There is a document that is part of the Software materials (also our Data and Code) called **Getting Started with R**, available [in R Markdown](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/SOFTWARE/431-getting-started-with-R.Rmd) and [in PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/SOFTWARE/431-getting-started-with-R.pdf) formats. We'll spend a little time with it today, but it's meant to be something you can work through on your own. 
    - This provides a worked example of using R Markdown to process a document (the R Markdown version) into a knitted file (HTML or PDF, for instance) combining results and code.
    - The examples explore (1) some data from an experiment on the growth rate of chickens in response to several different feed supplements, and then (2) some data on the growth of orange trees.
5. I now expect to get complete [Course Project](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/tree/master/PROJECT) information to you by Tuesday 2019-09-10. If you have questions in the interim, please ask them at 431-help.
