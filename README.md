# 2019-431

This will be the public web site for my 431 course in Fall 2019 at Case Western Reserve University. 
Materials will appear between now and the start of class in August.

The class will be held on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1:00 - 2:15 PM in Room E321-323 of the Robbins Building at the CWRU School of Medicine, starting on 2019-08-27. [Here's the calendar of class sessions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/calendar.md).

Contact me via email at thomas dot love at case dot edu if you have questions about the course that are not answered here. I will start to address those questions in mid-July.
