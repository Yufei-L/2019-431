# 2019-431

This will be the public web site for my 431 course in Fall 2019 at Case Western Reserve University. 431 is the first part of a two-semester sequence (PQHS 431-432) taught by Professor Thomas Love in the Department of Population and Quantitative Health Sciences. 

Materials will appear here between now and the start of class in August.

The class will be held on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1:00 - 2:15 PM in Room E321-323 of the Robbins Building at the CWRU School of Medicine, starting on 2019-08-27. [Here's the calendar of class sessions](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/calendar.md).
