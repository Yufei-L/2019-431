## Key Links 

- The [Course Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-431-syllabus/)
    - This includes details on Professor Love and the teaching assistants, software, the course texts, and more.
- The [Course Calendar](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/calendar.md) is the final word for all deadlines, and provides links for all deliverables and class sessions.
- Professor Love's [Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-431-book/)
    - This is the main textbook, and provides a series of examples of using R to work through issues that will likely come up in the course. Its current title is "[Data Science for Biological, Medical and Health Research](https://thomaselove.github.io/2019-431-book/)"
- Slides and other materials for each class will also be provided, with links to presentation materials and READMEs for each class session to be found in the [Course Calendar](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/calendar.md).
    - Each class session begins with a review of that day's README, which contains links to Professor Love's slides, data sets we'll use in class, interesting tidbits from the news, and the internet, responses to student surveys, and various other materials. 

## Other Important Pages

- [Software Installation and Tips](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/tree/master/SOFTWARE) to help you install R, RStudio and R packages, along with the data you'll need, and then to help you get rolling with those tools.
- [Data (and Code)](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431-data) for the course's deliverables, presentations, and notes.
- [Readings and Supplemental Materials](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/2019-431/blob/master/READINGS.md) I'll refer to during the course.

## Deliverables

There are several types of assignments for this course, including regular "minute paper" surveys, more traditional "homework" Deliverables, a Course Project, and at least two Quizzes.

## Pep Talk! (Thanks, [Andrew Heiss](https://evalf19.classes.andrewheiss.com/syllabus/#pep-talk))

Learning R can be difficult at first - it’s like learning a new lanugage, just like Spanish, French, or Chinese. Hadley Wickham—the chief data scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you’ll be using like `ggplot2` [made this wise observation](https://r-posts.com/advice-to-young-and-old-programmers-a-conversation-with-hadley-wickham/):

> It’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.

If you’re finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, ask questions at `431-help at case dot edu`, e-mail Dr. Love, etc.

I promise you can do this.

## Old Versions of the Course

If you are a former student, or for some other reason need to see the 431 course in its previous iterations, contact Dr. Love via email.

- Some people will want to see [the Fall 2018 version of the Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/2018-431-book/), for instance.
